LeapNetEncoded: D3QN on a state encoded by a leap net
======================================================

TODO reference the original papers `ESANN Paper <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02268886>`_
`Leap Net <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231220305051>`_

That has now be implemented as a github repository `Leap Net Github <https://github.com/BDonnot/leap_net>`_

Description
-----------
The Leap is a type of neural network that has showed really good performances on the predictions of flows on
powerlines based on the injection and the topology.

In this baseline, we use this very same architecture to model encode the powergrid state (at a given
step).

Then this embedding of the powergrid is used by a neural network (that can be a regular network or
a leap net) that parametrized the Q function.

An example to train this model is available in the train function :ref:`Example-leapnetenc`.

.. warning::
        This baseline recodes entire the RL training procedure. You can use it if you
        want to have a deeper look at Deep Q Learning algorithm and a possible (non 
        optimized, slow, etc. implementation ).
        
        For a much better implementation, you can reuse the code of "PPO_RLLIB" 
        or the "PPO_SB3" baseline.
